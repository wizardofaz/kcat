Selecting the CW keyboard menu item on the Utils menu opens the CW dialog.
This is a fully interactive morse code generator.  It uses the 505DSP
internal firmware for generating the code.  This means that the timing
and the CW waveform shape is controlled by the transceiver.

The large blank control is the text entry which accepts text from either the
keyboard or from one of the macro button closures.  When the Send button is
enabled (lit) the text will be sent one character at a time. As the text is
sent it will scroll off the control to the left in a marquee style.  You can
pause the transmission at any time by pressing the Send button which acts as
a toggle switch.  The currently sent character will be finished by the
transceiver.  If you press the Abort button the text transmission will stop
and the transceiver will immediately return to receive.  Any character being
sent will be truncated.

Press function key F1...F12 to add the macro text to the end of the transmit
text buffer.  You can also press the associated button with the mouse
left-click.

Right-click with the mouse in the text buffer control to open a pop-up menu.

You can cut, copy and paste to/from another application.  Use the left-mouse
drag to mark text.

You can clear the text buffer from this pop-up

Enter the data for each contact in the STA - station call, NAM - operator
name, Freq: - frequency of operation, X_in - contest exchange received.

Clear the logbook area by pressing the Clear button

If you are running the program fllog, a logbook server program, you can
connect to the server for the purpose of logging your exchange, looking
up previous QSOs (automatic), and checking for duplicates during a CW
contest.  Check the Connect box and the program will start data exchanges
with the server.  If the connection is successful the button remains
checked.  If not then it returns to the unchecked state.  Upon successful
connection the Log button and the Ck Dups buttons are activated.  Press
the Log button to log the current qso (also see below for use of macros
and duplicate parameter selection).  Press the Ck Dups button for contest
duplicate checking.   Simply enter the STA callsign and if it is a dup the
control will turn red.

Pressing the Configure button on the keyboard dialog will open up the
Configure dialog for the keyboard.  You can customize the  macro buttons for
various canned transmissions.  These transmissions can include various
computed tags.  The tags are

| Tag    | Description |
| :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <CLL>  | your callsign, entered in the CLL control                       |
| <QTH>  | your QTH, entered in the QTH control                            |
| <LOC>  | your Locator, entered in the LOC control                        |
| <OPR>  | your name, entered in the OPR control                           |
| <STA>  | the other stations callsign, entered in the STA control above   |
| <NAM>  | the other stations name, entered in the NAM control above       |
| <#>    | Contest: serial number, starting # entered in Next # control    |
| <+>    | Contest: increment the serial number                            |
| <->    | Contest: decrement the serial number                            |
| <LOG>  | Logbook: send the data to the fllog server program (if running) |
| <X>    | Contest: send the contents of the Xout control                  |

Prosigns are sent using the indicated keyboard character.  For example,
the % character will send the AS prosign.

Check the Zeros control if you want each serial number to have leading zeros.

Duplicates can be tested for callsign only, or callsign plus a time span
using the "Time Span" and "Ck span" controls.  You can also include a
requirement for the band the match, "Ck Band"

The CW-keyboard character WPM and the Paddle WPM controls are mirrored on the
CW tab pulldown and the cw-keyboard dialog.

Farnsworth code speed allows characters to be sent at a faster rate that the
word rate.  For example you can send the characters at 24 wpm and the word
rate at 15 wpm.  The program will adjust the inter character and inter word
spacing to produce the desired effect.  This capability is only available
using the CW keyboard and not from the CW paddle or key inputs.  Set the
word rate and enable the Farnsworth check box to use this feature.
