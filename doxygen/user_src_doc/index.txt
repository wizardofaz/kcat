\section sKcatDesc Kachina Universal Computer Control Program

This is a computer control program for the Kachina 505DSP transceiver.  The
program is supported on the following operating systems:

<ul>
  <li>Linux</li>
  <li>Puppy-linux</li>
  <li>OS X</li>
  <li>Windows 2000</li>
  <li>Windows NT</li>
  <li>Windows XP</li>
  <li>Windows Vista</li>
  <li>Windows Win7</li>
  <li>Windows Win8<br>
  </li>
</ul>

\section sSetup First time setup

<center>
\image latex Serial-port-select.eps "" width=3.6in

</center>

You will need to select the serial port to which your transceiver is
connected.  This screen capture shows the ports on one of my Linux systems.
Windows would list the COM ports that are installed (and not currently in
use).

Select TEST if you want to test drive the program without actually
connecting to the 505.  If you do select TEST this dialog will appear
every time you start the program.  The program will attempt to use the
last used serial port when starting after a satisfactory operating
session.

The program allows you to control many aspects of the user interface
including fonts, foreground colors, background colors, lighted button colors,
and the Scheme (general appearance of controls).  Here is an example of a
possible set of user choices:

After you become familiar with the various controls you will probably want
to turn off the tooltips.  Uncheck the "Enable tooltips" menu item on the
"Config" menu.

\section sOpControls Operating Controls

<center>
\image latex frequency-controls.eps "" width=3.5in

</center>

The frequency display is also a control.  Each numeric is sensitive to mouse
left/right buttons for up/down and to the mouse scroll wheel for rapidly
changing values.  Click on any of the numeric segments and you can enter a
new frequency using the keyboard numeric keypad.  If you make an error
simply enter a non-numeric key (press the Esc key).  Use the period key to
separate the kHz from the Hz value.  Set the newly entered frequency by
pressing the Enter key.

</center>


The second image shows the tool tip for the frequency control

Vfo-A and Vfo-B are separate controls, A on the left, B on the right.

When the mouse pointer is over the frequency display you can also change
frequency values using the arrow and page key buttons:

<ul>
	<li>left / right arrow - increase / decrease 1 Hz</li>
    <li>up / down arrow - increase / decrease 10 Hz</li>
    <li>Page Up / Page Down - increase / decrease 100 Hz</li>
</ul>
<br>

<center>
\image latex vfo-buttons.eps "" width=3.5in
\image html vfo-buttons.png ""
</center>

<br>

These buttons control how each vfo is used

<ul>
  <li> [A/A] - Rx on A, Tx on A </li>
  <li> [A/B] - Rx on A, Tx on B </li>
  <li> [-->] - transfer vfoA to vfoB</li>
  <li> [<--] - transfer vfoB to vfoA</li>
  <li> [B/A] - Rx on B, Tx on A</li>
  <li> [B/B] - Rx on B, Tx on B</li>
</ul>

Each "vfo" consists of the frequency, mode, bandwidth triad.

<center>
\image latex vfo-list.eps "" width=1.8in
\image html vfo-list.png ""
</center>

The active vfo triad can be saved to the vfo list using the [|>] button,
the selected vfo triad can be deleted from the list using the [X] button, and
all of the entries can be deleted using the [ ] button

The buttons that have a light box are toggles - activated when the lighted
box is colored.  Some of these are linked to a slider.  If the button state
is inactive then that associated slider will be greyed out.  In the example
the volume control is active and the RIT and IF shift controls are inactive.
The volume slider will be greyed out when the Spkr button is not
illuminated.  Sliders can also be adjusted using the mouse wheel when the
mouse cursor is over the intended control.

\subsection ssKcatFldigi Connecting kcat to FLDIGI

<center>
\image latex fldigi-kcat.eps "" width=1.5in
\image html fldigi-kcat.png ""
</center>

Xmlrpc is used via a local socket device for the two programs to
communicate.  FLDIGI acts as the server and kcat the client.  There is no
requirement for start / stop ordering of the programs.  Your local firewall
should be set up to allow FLDIGI access to the 127.0.0.1 socket address.

kcat sends rig configuration data to FLDIGI when the two programs initially
recognize each other.  This data is used to populate the rig name, the
available modes and the available bandwidths.

After this initial communications the operator can set the paired controls
from either FLDIGI or kcat.  The two programs will remain synchronized.

PTT can be activated at kcat or using the T/R button on FLDIGI.  FLDIGI
also engages the PTT via the macro <TX> <RX> tags.  When operating digital
modes with FLDIGI you need to use the PTT from FLDIGI.

Access to additional controls is obtained by pressing the
\ref kcat_extra_page "down-arrow button".

PTT - can be selected via the h/w PTT line, the PTT dialog button, or from a
support application such as FLDIGI.

Tune - command the internal antenna tuner to tune to the current frequency
and antenna port.

A/T - turn the automatic antenna tuner on and off.  Pressing Tune will place
the A/T in the On condition

Carr - transmit a carrier at the AM carrier level.

\subsection ssAntennaPorts Antenna Ports

<center>
\image latex AntennaControl.eps "" width=1.25in

</center>

You can set the antenna combinations of A/B, Rx/Tx to be used with various
frequency bands.  The menu item Config / Antenna Ports provides access to the
set up dialog.  You can also over ride those settings by choosing from the
Ant: table pick list.  details on
