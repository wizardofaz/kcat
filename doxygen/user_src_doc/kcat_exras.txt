The internal keyer can be enabled for left or right handed operation.  It
can also be configured for straight key operation.  The words/min, weight
and attack of the keyed waveform can be set.  The Kachina Pegasus is a QSK
rig.  Select QSK operation by enabled the QSK check box.   Press the Spot
button to hear an injected tone at the side tone (Offset frequency).  Use
this for zero beat with a received signal.

You can adjust the keyer sidetone relative to the received audio.  Set the
control to zero if you do want to hear the sidetone.  The Offset frequency
is the CW BFO pitch.  You can elect to use the narrow or wide filter for
CW.  The Farnsworth controls are associated with the
\ref cw_keyboad_page "CW Keyboard".

\section sVOX VOX

You can operate the Kachina with manual SSB PTT or with VOX.  The three
Vox controls are controlled IAW the Kachina manual.


\section sSpeech Speech

You can enable the SSB speech level (recommended only with headphones) or
monitor the digital audio that is applied to the rear panel auxiliary
connector.  The compression level is also adjustable and speech compression
can be enabled or disabled as suited.  Do not use speech processing with
digital mode audio.

\section sRX RX

The squelch control can be used to open the audio based on either level or
syllabic action.  -127 dbm setting disables the squelch.  A sliding button
indicator next to the smeter indicator shows the position of the level
squelch.  AGC action and AGC speed can be adjusted to suit the operating
requirements.

\section sTX TX

Enable the "Amp on/off" if you want the Kachina to operate with an amplifier
that is keyed. Adjust the equalization to accentuate portions of the speech
spectrum.  Low values increase base, high values increase treble

\section sMOC Master Oscillator Calibration

<center>

The signal frequencies internal to the Kachina are all derived from a single
oscillator.  That oscillator can be corrected for frequency errors.

\section sAMFanal Advanced multi-frequency analysis

<center>

Proceed as follows.

Simple single frequency adjustment:

<ol>
	<li>Set the DDS adjust to 0</li>
	<li>Set the DDS offset to 0</li>
	<li>Tune the transceiver to to external reference (WWV at 10 MHz for
	    example).</li>
	<li>Set the transceiver to CW mode, 1 KHz bandwidth</li>
	<li>Adjust the volume control so that you can hear the beat note</li>
	<li>Turn the CW spot control ON and adjust the Spot volume so that both
	    the WWV and the Spot notes are about the same amplitude.</li>
	<li>Adjust the "DDS adjust (ppm)" for zero beat between the WWV and spot
	    tones.</li>
	<li>You're done</li>
</ol>

Advanced multi-frequency adjustment:


<ol>
	<li>Repeat 1 through 6 above for each of 5/10/15 MHz WWV signals
	    (or other signals available at your QTH). At each frequency
	    adjust the "DDS offset" control for zero beat. This will vary
	    with each external reference frequency.</li>
	<li>Record the frequency and the offset value need for zero beat.</li>
	<li>Enter these into a spreadsheet program (preferably Gnumeric
	    or Xcel).</li>
	<li>Plot the pairs and you should get something similar to that shown at
	    the left.</li>
	<li>Perform a regression analysis on the pairs to determine both the
	    slope and the y intercept of the extended curve.</li>
	<li>Enter the slope value into the "DDS adjust (ppm)" control</li>
	<li>Enter the intercept value into the "DDS offset" control.</li>
	<li>You are done.</li>
</ol>

Using FLDIGI with the above:

Set FLDIGI to the frequency analysis mode.  Set the waterfall cursor at the
CW tone (i.e. 700 Hz).  When each reference is adjusted the WF signal should
be exactly at the CW tone frequency.  This will occur at zero beat.
