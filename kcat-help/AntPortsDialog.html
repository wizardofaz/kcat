<h2>Antenna Port Assignments</h2>

<br>

<img style="width: 268px; height: 198px; float: left;" alt="" src="images/AntennaPorts.png" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="8">To modify an existing entry in the Antenna Ports List:<br>

select it with the mouse (left click)<br>

Change the frequency (kHz), the port associated with transmit (A/B) and receive.<br>

Press the Add button.<br>

This will create a new entry in the table. &nbsp;You can then delete
the old entry by highlighting it and pressing the Delete button.<br>

<br>

The table is a progressive entry system. &nbsp;If for example, in the
illustration to the left, the 7000 entry were "7000 B B" then all
transceiver operation from 7000 kHz to the next entry of 10100 kHz
would be on antenna port B for both transmit &amp; receive. &nbsp;The
simplest table would be a single entry at 1800 A A. &nbsp;That would
cause the transceiver to always transmit &amp; receive on Port A. <br>

<br>

Be sure of your table entries before pressing the OK button.<br>
<h2>Override Port Assignments</h2>
<img style="width: 231px; height: 141px; float: left;" alt="" src="images/AntPort-force.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Under
most operating conditions you will want to use the antenna port
assignments as specified in the port configuration. &nbsp;You may on
occassion want to override that setting.&nbsp; The Ant: pick control
allows the selection of the Rx/Tx antenna combination.&nbsp; The 505DSP
can operate with Rx on either antenna
port and Tx on either antenna port independent of each other.&nbsp; The
default is to use the table.
